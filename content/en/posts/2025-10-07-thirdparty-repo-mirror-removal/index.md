Per the [official Gentoo news item](https://www.gentoo.org/support/news-items/2025-10-07-cache-enabled-mirrors-removal.html), Gentoo has stopped offering cache mirrors for third-party repositories. Starting 2025-10-30, the mirror config for all third-party repos (gentoo-zh included) gets dropped from the official repository list.

## What this means

- `eselect repository`, `layman` and friends keep working as usual
- Gentoo no longer mirrors third-party repos; they now sync straight from upstream (GitHub)
- Official repos (`::gentoo`, `::guru`, `::kde`, `::science`) are unaffected and still go through the mirrors

## If you already added gentoo-zh

Just update the sync URI — remove it and re-enable it, and the correct upstream source gets picked up automatically:

```bash
# List the installed repositories
eselect repository list -i

# Remove the old config
eselect repository remove gentoo-zh

# Re-enable it (automatically uses the correct upstream source)
eselect repository enable gentoo-zh
```

Then `emerge --sync gentoo-zh` as usual.

Adding gentoo-zh for the first time? You're not affected — just enable it normally from the [Overlay page](/overlay/). If connecting straight to GitHub from mainland China is slow for you, use the [mainland China git mirror](/overlay/#mirrors-for-mainland-china).
